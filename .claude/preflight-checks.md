# Pre-flight Checks

Before making code modifications, verify:

1. **Branch**: Never work on `main`/`master`. Create feature branch if needed.
2. **Uncommitted changes**: Note any pending changes before starting new work.

**Skip when:**

- Read-only operations (exploring, reading, explaining code)
- Already on a feature branch and continuing work
